# Creation
Languages and Frameworks: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask, Ploty, Pandas

When a user reports a news event, they must include a description of the occurrence, the location and/or coordinates, and a reputable source to account for the event.
When the report is submitted, the Flask web framework receives and accepts user input from the HTML form, which is then either processed for data display or stored in a database.
The Flask web framework works with the Python framework, Plotly, to prepare the data for visualization. 
Plotly converts the user input into data points for the interactive globe map scatter plot depicting a major world events. 
Following processing, the data will be available for users to interact with via front-end HTML.
